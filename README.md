# DDPM for Human Face Generation

This project implements a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) to generate realistic human faces from noise. This implementation demonstrates my understanding of modern generative modeling techniques, PyTorch, and deep learning workflows.

## Highlights 
* Implements a DDPM from scratch using PyTorch and Accelerate
* Trained on a unbiased dataset of human faces (FairFace)
* Includes:
  * training and evaluation loops
  * noise scheduling
  * sampling steps
  * exponential mean average (EMA) for evaluation and sampling 
  * model monitoring with tensorboards
* Generates diverse and realistic human faces from pure noise
* Modular and extensible codebase for experimentation

## If you want to run the code 

### 1. Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/DaliaO15/ddpm_model_faces.git
cd ddpm_model_faces
```

### 2. Install dependencies

[//]: # (Comment: add a env file)

### 3. Train the model
```
python Code/face_generation_main.py
```
[//]: # (Comment: add screenshot of the tensorboard)

### 4. Generate samples

[//]: # (Comment: add a inference module)

## Results

The model was trained on FairFAce at 128x128 resolution. Below are samples generated by the trained DDPM:

## Future Work

- Train on higher-resolution datasets or implement something to improve the resolution of the images in the training data as well as in the inference images
- Integrate classifier-free guidance for conditional generation
- Experiment with other diffusion model variants like LSD
